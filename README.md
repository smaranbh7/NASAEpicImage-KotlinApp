# Harry Potter Wiki App
 
 This repository contains a working directory of an Android application being developed as part of my Mobile App Development coursework. 
 The app will display detailed information of various characters from Harry Potter's wizard world, utilizing fragments and modern Android architecture components.
 
 ## Features added upto date:
 
 ### UI Design
 * Recycler Views: Used to display a list of items in a scrollable and efficient way.
 
 * Constraint Layout: A flexible layout system used to design responsive UIs.
 
 * Linear Layout: A simple layout that arranges views in a single row or column.
 
 ### Architecture
 * Detail Fragments: Displays detailed information when an item is selected from a list.
 
 * ViewModel: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, allowing data to survive configuration changes.
 
 ### Dependency Injection
